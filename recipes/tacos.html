    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Possimus quas quos hic nam voluptatibus soluta iure, ad praesentium vitae saepe eveniet quia porro, assumenda laboriosam voluptates dicta minus tenetur nihil.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>1 (3.25 ounce) package instant mashed potatoes (such as Idahoan™ Signature Russets Mashed Potatoes)
        ½ cup diced onions
        1 tablespoon vegetable oil

        Step 1

        Prepare mashed potatoes according to package directions.
        Step 2
        
        Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sautee diced onions in oil until tender and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Add cooked mashed potatoes and season with salt and pepper.
        Step 3
        
        Place tortillas on a plate. Heat in microwave until pliable, 15 to 20 seconds.
        Step 4
        
        Place 1/4 cup of potato mixture in each tortilla, fold in half and secure each end with toothpicks.
        Step 5
        
        Heat oil in a skillet until shimmering. Fry each taco until crispy and golden brown, about 1 minute on each side.
        Step 6
        
        Remove toothpicks and top with garnishes.
